# Hardware Modeling Using Verilog â€“ NPTEL IIT Kharagpur

This repository contains my personal Verilog practice codes, examples, and notes inspired by the **"Hardware Modeling Using Verilog"** course from **IIT Kharagpur** offered on the NPTEL platform.  
It serves as a structured record of my learning, starting from basic Verilog syntax to advanced hardware design concepts.

## ðŸ“š Learning Source
- **Course**: Hardware Modeling Using Verilog  
- **Institute**: IIT Kharagpur (NPTEL Online Certification Course)  
- **Instructor**: Prof. <Add Name Here>  
- **Course Link**: [NPTEL - Hardware Modeling Using Verilog](<ADD_COURSE_LINK_HERE>)

Each folder will contain:
- `.v` Verilog source files
- Testbench files
- Notes (if required)

## ðŸ›  Tools for Simulation
You can simulate these codes using:
- **Icarus Verilog** â€“ for compilation & simulation
- **GTKWave** â€“ for waveform visualization
- Or commercial tools like ModelSim, Vivado, etc.

**Example simulation:**
```bash
iverilog my_module.v my_module_tb.v
vvp a.out
gtkwave dump.vcd
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
1. Build a solid understanding of **Verilog HDL**.
2. Practice **combinational** and **sequential** circuit design.
3. Write effective **testbenches** for verification.
4. Learn **synthesis-oriented coding styles**.
